#### Question ####
> *onCreate* is passed a parameter *(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)*. What is this? What value will it
> have on first run. Please evidence this value with the use of the debugger and an appropriate screenshot.   
>
> What may cause this Bundle to change in DiceRoller?
>
> In your own implementation of DiceRoller, are you using this Bundle in anyway. Please note that depending on

| ![dessertclicker part 1](./images/placeholder.jpg) | ![dessertclicker part 2](./images/placeholder.jpg) |


#### Question ####
> In completing the extension for DessertClicker you will have created a ViewModel class. Why is a viewmodel
> class instance created with the first line shown below and not the second? 
>
> **val viewModel: DessertViewModel = viewModel()** 
>
> **val viewModel: DessertViewModel = DessertViewModel()** 
>
> How might this understanding be evidenced through the use of the debugger. Please include a screenshot.
> 
> What design patterns are being used here.  
>
> (Please note that if you have not completed the extension to DessertClicker - you can use MarsPhoto ViewModel as the 
> case study for the question)

### MarsPhoto ###

|    **First Part ${\color{green}-- todo}$**    |    **Extension ${\color{green}-- todo}$**     |
|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
| ![marsphoto part 1](./images/placeholder.jpg) | ![marsphoto part 2](./images/placeholder.jpg) |


#### Question ####
> In MarsPhoto an external API is used to populate the application. This required a change to the manifest
> file to allow this to happen. What change was this?  
>
> If this change was not there, what would be the implication when the app was run? Please indicate as part of the 
> answer the exception that is thrown by including a screenshot from the Logcat window.
> 
> Finally as part of this question â€“ the manifest file will have an IntentFilter applied to an Activity. In the MarsPhoto, this would be: 
>  
> *&lt;intent-filter&gt;*
> 
> *&lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;*  
> *&lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;*
> 
> *&lt;/intent-filter &gt;*
>
> Please expand on the purpose of this
